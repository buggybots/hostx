## Data Science Immersive Capstone Project

Recently, I pursued a Data Science Immersive course and worked on a capstone project that aimed at improving Airbnb host listings. The goal of the project was to leverage Natural Language Processing to analyse guest reviews and to identify how host listings can be boosted to improve bookings and hence revenue for both Airbnb hosts and Airbnb.
